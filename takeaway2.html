    <h1>Today learning</h1>
    <p>I learned that you can even make some calculation in console<br>
       I learned about the statement which is the instructions you give to the <br>
       computer and execute it one by one.<br>
       I learned also the two types of comment in JS which are:<br>
       Single line comment(//) and multiline-lines comment(/*..*/).
